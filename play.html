                <h4 class="name">SCENE:</h4> _The living-room in the Mather home in Boston._

            <p class="speech">
                The stage represents the living-room of the Mather home. A large
                colonial fireplace is seen down-stage left, within which stand huge
                brass andirons. To one side hangs the bellows, with the tongs near
                by, while above, underneath the mantelpiece, is suspended an old
                flint-lock rifle. On both ends of the mantel are brass
                candlesticks, and hanging directly above is an old-fashioned
                portrait of Betty's mother. There are two doors, one leading into
                the hall at centre left, the other, communicating with the rest of
                the house, up-stage right. A straight high-backed settee is
                down-stage right, while in the centre back towers an old
                grandfather's clock.[K] To the left of the clock is the window,
                cross-barred and draped with flowered chintz. An old-fashioned
                table occupies the corner between the window and the hall door.
                Here and there are various straight-backed chairs of Dutch origin.
                Rag rugs cover the floor._

                But you must understand that marriage, my daughter, is a most
                reverend and serious matter which should be approached in a manner
                fittingly considerate of its grave responsibility.

                be learned and laid up in the heart. I will not always be with thee and
                I would like to be comfortably assured of thy future welfare before I
                go.
